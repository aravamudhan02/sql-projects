This repository documents my structured learning journey in SQL, covering essential concepts and practical problem-solving skills relevant to data analytics, business insights, and reporting.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics I Have Practiced & Learned

### ðŸ”¹ SQL Basics
- Writing `SELECT` statements to fetch data from single and multiple columns
- Using `WHERE` clauses for filtering based on conditions
- Sorting data using `ORDER BY`
- Grouping and summarizing data using `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`

### ðŸ”¹ Working with Joins
- Applying `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN` to combine data across tables
- Understanding how unmatched records behave in different join types
- Practiced join-based scenarios such as:
  - Customers and orders
  - Employees and departments
  - Sales data analysis

### ðŸ”¹ Intermediate Querying
- Used `ALIAS` for cleaner queries and temporary naming
- Applied `CASE` statements for conditional logic inside SELECT
- Practiced nested subqueries and filtering based on derived results
- Wrote queries using `DISTINCT` and `IN`, `NOT IN` filters

### ðŸ”¹ Advanced SQL (Introduction Level)
- Introduced to `Window Functions` like `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `DENSE_RANK()` to solve ranking problems
- Practiced use cases involving:
  - First order per customer
  - Highest and lowest sales per employee
- Learned and practiced writing `CTEs` (Common Table Expressions) for better query readability

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of This Repository

Even though this repository does not contain `.sql` files yet, it serves as a portfolio entry summarizing the SQL-related concepts Iâ€™ve learned and practiced. 
It reflects my journey through fundamental, intermediate, and early advanced SQL skills relevant to real-world analytics.

In the future, I plan to add:
- Actual `.sql` files
- Small datasets for analysis
- Practice challenges and solutions
